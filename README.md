# VAPT-On-API

Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing on API
This project focuses on Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on APIs, providing a comprehensive security evaluation for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in API-based systems. The project employs various automated and semi-automated security testing tools to analyze the security posture of APIs.

📌 Project Overview
With the growing importance of cybersecurity, VAPT ensures that APIs are robust against potential cyber threats. The project involves:

Information Gathering: Using tools like Postman and Burp Suite to explore endpoints and authentication mechanisms.
Vulnerability Assessment: Performing scans with OWASP ZAP to detect potential weaknesses.
Penetration Testing: Conducting exploit attempts to simulate real-world attacks.
Reporting: Generating detailed security reports with identified vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.


🛠️ Tools Used
Automated Testing Tools: Burp Suite, Postman
Semi-Automated Testing Tools: OWASP ZAP, JWT_Tool


🔍 Testing Methodologies
Black Box Testing: Simulating real-world attack scenarios without prior knowledge of the system.
API Security Checks: Evaluating authentication, authorization, and input validation mechanisms.


📜 Features
API Scanning & Reconnaissance
Security Vulnerability Identification
Exploitation & Attack Simulation
Comprehensive Security Reporting


🚀 Future Scope
Integration of AI-driven security testing for better vulnerability detection.
Expanding the testing suite with tools like Nmap, Wireshark, SQLMap, Nessus, Metasploit, and Nikto.
